DJing 

(pre-work)
Load all tracks that might be played into library
    Set cue locations at transitonary parts of track
    Make sure BPMs and phasing of beat grids and measures are correctly lined up on all tracks

(LIVE SET)
Load Track A to Deck 1
Play Track A Deck 1 to master
  Find Track B with BPM in close range of track A's BPM and matching Key signatures
Load Track B to Deck 2
  Find outro cue of Track A that best algins with intro cue of Track B to trigger Track B on
  Synchronize Track A and B's BPM's, B to A, so A is Master BPM (to avoid sudden audbile shifts in tempo of whichever track is playing on Master Channel)
Play Track B to cue channel, not master
    check for any dissonance, conflicting rhythms or frequencies, if there are minimal to none (that can't resolve with line 19) continue to next step, 
    if not go back to line 8 (Find Track B..)
Fade Track B on Deck 2 into master
    If low-end frequency conflicts exist, cut out either (XOR) Track A or Track B's lowend once playing both to Master
Fade out Track A, and 
    If Track B's low-end was cut, fade in Track B's lowend before next major cue in track B (the main drop)

Repeat with all unplayed tracks, until all tracks in library are played or established time limit is reached for DJ set
