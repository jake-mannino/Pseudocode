DJing 

(pseudopseudocode)

(initial conditions)
Load all tracks that might be played into library
    Make sure BPMs and phasing of beat grids and measures are correctly lined up on all tracks
    Set cue locations at transitionary parts of tracks

(Live Set)
Load Track A to Deck 1
Play Track A Deck 1 to master
  Find Track B with BPM in close range of (or equal to) track A's BPM and matching Key signatures
Load Track B to Deck 2
  Find outro cue of Track A that best algins with intro cue of Track B to trigger Track B on
  Synchronize Track A and B's BPM's, B to A, so A is Master BPM (to avoid sudden audbile shifts in tempo of whichever track is playing on Master Channel)
Play Track B to cue channel, not master
    check for any dissonance, conflicting rhythms or frequencies, if there are minimal to none (that can't resolved with line 21) continue to next step, 
    if not go back to line 13 after (Find Track B..)
Fade Track B on Deck 2 into master
    If low-end frequency conflicts exist, cut out either (XOR) Track A or Track B's lowend before playing both to Master
Fade out Track A from master
    If Track B's low-end was cut, fade in Track B's lowend before next major cue in track B (the main drop)

Repeat with all unplayed tracks, until all tracks in library are played or established time limit is reached for DJ set
    
Objects:
    Track library
        Displays of BPMS and Cue points
    Cue points (locations set in track metadata)
        when triggered play track from that locations
           1-8 for all tracks
        intro cues
        outro cues
    Cue buttons to trigger cue points
           1-8 for each deck
    Tracks
        played
        unplayed
        bpm
        cue points
        key signatures
    Decks
        1
        2
    Master channel
    Cue channel (to headphones)
    Syncronize bpms of tracks loaded
        (to master deck)
          sync button on each deck that syncs it to track bpm loaded on other deck
    levels, gains knobs, crossfaders (for fade in / out)
        low-end freq eq knobs for each deck
    
  
    
Functions (rougher outline redid this further below):
    Find best Track
    Find best Intro cue
    Find best outro cue
         of master deck (being played to master) or Deck 2 (assuming not the master)
    Find drop cue
    load Track (x) to deck (X)
    Synchronize BPMs of tracks loaded on decks (X to master Deck)
    Play track/deck from selected Deck 2 cue to cue channel
    
    Play track/deck from selected cue to master channel
     
    Fade track/deck signal into cue channel and or (OR) master
    fade track/deck signal out cue channel and or (OR) master
    
    fade low frequencies of Track (X) out of master and cue
    Fade low frequencies of Track (X) into master and cue
        
    
    Identify if tracks mix check for dissonance
         if, else for loop back 
         if else for resolving conflicting low-end freqs
    
    loops until all tracks have been played or time limit reached
       
       mark track as played after playing it
